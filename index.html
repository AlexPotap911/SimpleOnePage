            Be mindful when drinking tea. Taking a mindful tea break is a powerful way to stop the racing mind and come to the present moment. Make a tea and as you drink it, bring your attention fully to the experience by tuning into your senses. Feel the warmth of the cup in your hands, taste the tea with each sip, notice the sounds around you. When you feel your mind wandering, let go of thoughts and come back to the sensations of the warmth of the tea cup in your hands.
